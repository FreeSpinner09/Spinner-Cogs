# McSync Cog

A Red Discord Bot cog that syncs Minecraft usernames with Discord users via a **2-step auth code**,  
confirms their presence online via RCON, and rewards them with configurable commands.

---

## Features

- Two-step auth code sync:
  - `!sync <username>` â†’ Sends code in-game via RCON
  - `!sync <username> <code>` â†’ Confirms sync and executes rewards
- Rewards executed via RCON with `{user}` replaced by Minecraft username
- Admins can configure RCON per guild (`!rcon set <host> <port> <password>`)
- Role-based permission system for checking link status
- Admin commands: `unsyncmc`, `setcheckerroles`, `setreward`, `rcon test/clear`
- Secure: original RCON messages deleted on setup, temporary auth codes stored in memory
